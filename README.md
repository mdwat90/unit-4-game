# unit-4-game

#This is a Star Wars themed RPG game. In this game, you will select your character, and then select an enemy to attack.

#Once the enemy has been selected, an attack button will appear. Press this button to attack your opponent.

#Both your character and your opponent will have health points and attack power. Upon each press of the attack button, both your opponent and your character's health will go down based
#on the attack power of each character.

# Each time the attack button is pressed, your character's attack power increases by the original amount of attack power with which they started.

#Once your current opponent is defeated, you may select a new opponent. Once all enemies are defeated, you have won the game.

#This project was an exercise for the practice of basic jQuery and javascript concepts.
